# What is this for?
Basically this is for my personal approach to watch anime without seeing pop-up ads, banner ads, and all kinda ads that source is came. So I make this scrape for me to watch without interuppted with ads and it's streaming not fully downloaded.
And checkout to this project if you want to submit your watch progress into your own myanimelist.net account while watching. [mpv-myanimelist](https://github.com/arifldhewo/mpv-myanimelist)
